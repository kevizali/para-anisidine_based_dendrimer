# Evaluation of quantum-chemical, physico-chemical and drug-likeness properties of para-substituted aniline based dendritic architecture: an in-silico and machine learning approach.

Abstract: Dendrimers are polymeric compounds which exhibit notable advantages, particularly in medicinal chemistry. They are synthesized through multi-step reactions and these compounds possess distinctive features including well-defined structure, uniformity, and the capability to transport drugs. In-silico methods are best approach for screening of therapeutic potential of these molecular architectures which also helps in identifying the one with highest potential for further investigation. Here, we have reported in-silico investigation of a series of dendritic architecture based on para substituted aniline and their drug-likeness behaviour. Density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to optimize the structures and also to analyse the quantum chemical parameters. The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) profiling was additionally assessed, unveiling favourable drug-like characteristics and moderate to good bioactivity across all compounds. Utilizing the drug-likeness property in machine learning techniques, the potential for predicting novel drug-like dendrimers was explored.

Keywords: in-silico, quantum chemical, physico-chemical, drug-likeness, bioactivity, machine learning.
