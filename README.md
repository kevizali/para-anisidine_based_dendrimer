Abstract: An in-silico investigation of eight para-anisidine based dendritic architecture is reported in this work. The optimized geometries of the compounds were obtained using density functional theory (DFT) method. The HOMO-LUMO values were calculated along with other important quantum chemical parameters such as ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical hardness, chemical softness, electronegativity, electrophilicity index, nucleophilicity index and, maximum charge transfer index. The molecular electrostatic potential maps were also obtained from DFT. The ADMET studies of the compounds for physico-chemical and potential pharmacological properties were analysed using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Client and Molinspiration. Machine learning techniques were employed to predict the drug likeness of the compounds. This analysis revealed good drug-likeness property and good to moderate bioactivity for all compounds. 
Keywords: in-silico, quantum chemical, physico-chemical, drug-likeness, bioactivity, machine learning.
